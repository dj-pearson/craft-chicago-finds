30-Day Social Media Plan for CraftLocal Launch
Campaign Overview

CraftLocal (craftlocal.net) is a new online craft marketplace focused on connecting Chicago’s local artisans and makers with shoppers who love unique, handmade goods. The platform officially launches on November 1 – just in time for the holiday shopping season. This 30-day social media plan (primarily the month of October leading up to launch) is designed to build excitement, encourage Chicago vendors to register, and raise awareness among local shoppers about the upcoming launch. We will utilize Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (X), with organic posts (no paid ads) at a high frequency (ideally daily, or at minimum 3x per week) to maximize reach and engagement. Consistent daily posting is recommended, as studies suggest posting about once per day on platforms like Facebook is optimal for business engagement

. Maintaining a steady, reliable posting schedule is crucial because consistency builds audience trust and anticipation – followers begin to recognize your posts and look forward to them

Objectives:

Vendor Sign-ups: Drive local Chicago artisans and craft vendors to sign up on CraftLocal starting Nov 1, emphasizing the opportunity to sell their products during the lucrative holiday season. (Note: 62% of consumers say they’re more likely to buy from a small business if it’s local
quickbooks.intuit.com
– we want vendors to leverage that local advantage.)

Brand Awareness: Introduce CraftLocal’s brand, mission, and value proposition to the community. Highlight how CraftLocal supports the “shop local” movement by bringing Chicago-made gift items to a broader online audience.

Buzz & Community Engagement: Build excitement and conversation around the launch. Encourage sharing, word-of-mouth, and involvement (e.g. comments, tags, user-generated content) so that by launch day we have an engaged following ready to spread the word.

Holiday Positioning: Consistently remind both vendors and potential shoppers that CraftLocal is launching in time for holiday shopping (when demand for unique gifts is high). Emphasize supporting local businesses for the holidays – unique gifts are a big draw for shopping small (56% of shoppers choose small businesses for unique gift ideas
forbes.com
), so CraftLocal can fill that need.

Approach: We will run a 30-day countdown-style campaign through October. Posts will range from teaser announcements and informational content to interactive and promotional posts, all unified by a friendly, community-oriented brand voice. CraftLocal’s tone will be warm, creative, and supportive – we’re speaking as fellow craft lovers excited to help local makers succeed. Each piece of content will include a clear call-to-action where appropriate (e.g. “Sign up as a vendor,” “Follow for updates,” “Tag a friend who loves crafts,” etc.), and will incorporate relevant hashtags and visuals. We will also cross-post or tailor content to each platform: for example, Facebook can allow longer captions and event announcements, Instagram will focus on visual storytelling (with images of crafts or behind-the-scenes peeks), and Twitter/X will be used for quick updates, countdown reminders, and joining local conversations (using trending local hashtags).

Target Audience

Primary: Chicago-based craft vendors and artisans. These are small business owners, makers, DIY enthusiasts, Etsy sellers, and artisans in the Chicago area who could benefit from an online local marketplace. They might range from jewelry designers and woodworkers to soap makers, clothing designers, and artists. Our messaging to this group will highlight why they should join CraftLocal – for example, gaining exposure to local customers, low fees (if applicable), ease of use, and being part of a local makers community. We will frequently include “Calling all Chicago makers!” type messages and emphasize that vendor registration opens Nov 1. We’ll also stress the holiday angle: joining by Nov 1 means they can list products in time for the holiday rush (when a significant portion of sales occur for small businesses).

Secondary: Local shoppers in Chicago who value unique, handmade products. These include consumers who frequent craft fairs, farmers markets, or shop on Etsy, as well as those who prioritize supporting local businesses. They are the eventual buyers on CraftLocal. While the pre-launch campaign is mostly vendor-focused, we still want to build general awareness and excitement among these shoppers. Posts that describe what CraftLocal will offer (a convenient way to shop local artisans online) and teasers of product types or stories of makers will appeal to them. We want them to follow our pages for updates and be ready to start shopping once products are live.

By targeting both groups, we ensure that when launch day comes, we have a critical mass of sellers and interested buyers. Many posts will speak to both audiences in a broad sense (promoting the concept of the marketplace), while some will specifically call out vendors or shoppers as needed.

Key Messaging & Themes

Throughout the 30-day campaign, our content will revolve around a few key themes and messages:

Support Local / Community: Emphasize that CraftLocal is about Chicago’s community of creators. Buying on CraftLocal means supporting your neighbors and local economy. For vendors: selling on CraftLocal means reaching customers right in Chicago who care about local products. We will use messaging like “Support Chicago’s makers,” “Shop local, even online,” and highlight facts (e.g., “3 in 5 consumers prefer to buy from local small businesses”
quickbooks.intuit.com
) to reinforce this.

Holiday Gift Shopping: Continuously tie in the upcoming holidays. Messages such as “Holiday shoppers are looking for unique gifts – let’s give them Chicago-made choices!” or “Get your handmade gifts ready for the holiday rush” will appear. We’ll remind followers about key holiday dates (like Small Business Saturday on Nov 25) and position CraftLocal as the perfect platform for holiday gift hunting. (For example, “Skip the crowded malls – find one-of-a-kind gifts from Chicago artisans on CraftLocal this holiday.”)

Unique & Handmade: Celebrate the uniqueness of items that will be on CraftLocal. Use imagery of crafts and language like “handcrafted,” “one-of-a-kind,” “artisan-made.” For vendors, the message is their products are special and deserve a spotlight; for shoppers, the message is you’ll find treasures not available at big-box stores. We may feature sample product types (even if we don’t have actual sellers yet, we can talk about categories: e.g. “From handmade jewelry to custom decor, coming soon!”).

Ease & Opportunity: Reassure vendors that CraftLocal will be easy to use and beneficial. Mention any seller-friendly features (low fees, local pickup options, etc. if known from PRD). Also convey the opportunity of being an early adopter: “Be among the first Chicago makers on the platform” – early sign-ups could get extra exposure. For shoppers, convey convenience: “Browse local markets from home.”

Countdown to Launch: Create a sense of urgency and excitement as Nov 1 approaches. We’ll frequently mention how many days until launch, especially in the final week (e.g., “Only 5 days to go!”). Doing a countdown is a classic way to build excitement and gives us a natural reason to keep reminding people about the launch
canva.com
. Expect daily countdown posts in the last 5–7 days with enticing reminders.

Brand Introduction & Values: Early in the campaign, some posts will simply introduce CraftLocal – what it is and why it exists. We’ll share our mission (e.g., “Empowering local artisans through technology,” “bringing the craft fair to your fingertips”). If CraftLocal has a slogan or tagline (for example, “Your Local Crafts Marketplace”), we will incorporate that. We will also introduce our logo and branding so people start recognizing it. Consistent visuals (using our logo, brand colors, and snapshots of crafts/Chicago scenes) will establish brand identity.

All content will maintain a cohesive style: friendly and inspirational language, lots of community-oriented words (“we,” “together,” “community,” “local family”, etc.), and encouragement. Where possible, we’ll include visuals in every post – photos of crafts, Chicago landmarks with a crafty twist, illustrations, or even short videos (like a timelapse of someone making a craft, or a screen recording preview of the website interface). Visual content tends to get higher engagement and will help stop the scroll. We will ensure our posts are visually appealing and on-brand.

Finally, we will establish a campaign hashtag to tie everything together. A unique hashtag like #CraftLocalChicago (alongside the simple #CraftLocal) will be used on all platforms to categorize our launch content. Choosing a memorable, product-tied hashtag makes it easy for people to find all related posts and join the conversation
canva.com
. We’ll also leverage popular generic hashtags sparingly (e.g., #ShopLocal, #SupportSmallBusiness, #ChicagoMakers, #Handmade, #HolidayShopping) to increase discoverability, especially on Instagram and Twitter. (We’ll stick to 2-3 hashtags per Facebook/Twitter post and a few more on Instagram as appropriate
canva.com
to avoid clutter.)

Platforms & Tactics

Facebook: We will use Facebook for reaching community groups and sharing event-like announcements. Posts can be slightly longer form when telling a story or explaining benefits to vendors. We’ll also create a Facebook Event for the launch (“CraftLocal Launch – Nov 1”) so that it can be shared and people can RSVP/remind themselves. Facebook is ideal for local community sharing; we might post in neighborhood groups or business associations (with permission) about CraftLocal launching. Frequency: ~4-5 posts per week on the official page (some may be cross-posted from IG). We’ll encourage followers to share our posts to spread the word.

Instagram: This will showcase the visual side of CraftLocal. We’ll post images or short videos (Reels/Stories) of crafts, behind-the-scenes of makers (or of our team preparing the site), countdown graphics, etc. Instagram Stories can be used for quick daily countdown updates or polls (e.g., “What handmade gifts do you want to see on CraftLocal?”). We will also consider collaborating with local craft influencers on Instagram – perhaps an IG Live or a story takeover with a Chicago maker talking about the importance of selling local. Frequency: at least 5 posts/week (possibly daily). We will make use of relevant tags (e.g., tagging @MadeInChicago market pages or using location tags for Chicago). Visual consistency (using our logo, brand colors, and appealing photos) will be key on IG to establish brand identity
blog.ocoya.com
.

Twitter (X): We’ll use Twitter for quick-hit updates and joining broader conversations. Here we can tweet daily countdown reminders (“10 days until CraftLocal launch… 📣”), share snippets of our mission, and retweet relevant content (like a Chicago small biz news or a craft fair announcement) to engage with the community. We can also utilize Twitter to network – e.g., tweet at Chicago local business accounts or use trending hashtags like #SmallBusinessSaturday as it draws near. Frequency: likely daily tweets (possibly multiple tweets per day when there’s something big, but at least one per day). Twitter’s fast pace allows more frequency (even 3-7 tweets/day is acceptable
blog.ocoya.com
), but we will focus on making each tweet value-driven (not spammy). Short videos or GIFs can be used in tweets to increase engagement.

(Other Platforms:) Although not explicitly requested, if resources allow, TikTok could be a great place to post a few fun short videos (such as a montage of craft making or a humorous “day in the life of a crafter”) to appeal to a younger audience of makers/shoppers. Pinterest could later be used to pin products once live. For the 30-day pre-launch, we’ll focus on FB, IG, Twitter which have the core local audience and community features needed.

Hashtags & Tags: As mentioned, #CraftLocal and #CraftLocalChicago will be our primary campaign hashtags. We’ll mix in #ShopLocal, #Chicago, #ShopSmall, #MadeInChicago, #SupportLocal, #HandmadeHoliday, etc., when relevant to widen reach. We will also incorporate holiday-specific tags when appropriate (#HolidayGifts, #SmallBusinessSaturday closer to launch). We’ll keep hashtags relevant and not overdo it (quality over quantity) to ensure the posts look professional
canva.com
. Additionally, we’ll tag relevant accounts where possible – for instance, tag local business alliances, maker spaces, or community accounts like @ChiMakers (if exists) or @ChiSmallBiz to possibly get a share/retweet. Tagging a few well-chosen accounts can help amplify our message organically.

Engagement Strategy: Posting content is only half the battle – we’ll also actively engage with comments and community. We’ll respond to any questions (e.g., “How do I sign up?” – we’ll give friendly instructions and maybe DM them the link), thank people for supportive comments, and encourage more interaction by asking open questions in our captions (“What’s your favorite local holiday market in Chicago?”). Moreover, we will keep an eye on relevant conversations: for example, if people on Twitter discuss supporting local shops or if a local news article about holiday shopping trends comes out, the CraftLocal account can chime in with a thoughtful comment. This kind of community engagement shows we’re an active, friendly participant in the local small biz community, not just self-promoting. It also aligns with the recommendation to “make friends with your consumer” through social media interactions
agilie.com
. We might also encourage user-generated content by asking followers (especially vendors) to share photos of their crafts or workshop with our hashtag – we can then repost some of these (with permission) to showcase the makers (UGC is a great way to build authenticity and community loyalty
blog.ocoya.com
).

Now, the core of the plan – here is a day-by-day content calendar for the 30 days leading up to Nov 1. We will break it down by weeks for clarity. Each day’s post idea is described with its goal and content outline, and many can be adapted across Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (with formatting tweaks per platform). The schedule assumes starting on October 1, but can be adjusted if our timeline shifts slightly.

Week 1 (Oct 1 – Oct 7): Teasers and Brand Introduction

Theme: Create intrigue about “something new” for Chicago makers, then reveal CraftLocal and its mission. Early week focuses on teaser hints; mid-week we unveil the brand name/logo and explain what CraftLocal is. Late week begins to highlight why it’s exciting (benefits, local movement) and invites followers to spread the word.

Day 1 (Oct 1) – “Something New is Coming” Teaser: A mysterious teaser post to pique interest. For example, an image of a craft item (or a montage of Chicago skyline + handmade goods) with text overlay like “Coming Soon…”. Caption hints: “Calling all Chicago creators and lovers of handmade goods – something exciting is brewing for you this fall! 🎨🧵 Stay tuned for a big announcement… #comingsoon #Chicago”. No mention of the name yet. The goal is to create curiosity and start the conversation. (On Twitter, a simple “Big news for Chicago artisans coming soon… 👀 #comingsoon” could work.) Teaser campaigns that give glimpses without full details are proven to build expectation prior to launch
canva.com
, so we want to get people talking.

Day 2 (Oct 2) – Hint at the Problem & Solution: A post that identifies the need we’re addressing. For instance: “Tired of juggling local craft fairs and online marketplaces that don’t really feel ‘local’? We hear you.” Then hint that an online solution for Chicago makers is on the way. We could include a short anecdote or statistic about local makers (e.g., “Chicago has thousands of talented artisans – imagine if we could shop all their creations in one place!”). The tone is empathetic: we understand the challenge (for vendors: hard to reach local customers online; for shoppers: hard to find local artisans easily). This post sets up why CraftLocal is needed. It still doesn’t fully announce the product, but builds anticipation by confirming something is coming to solve this. Encourage comments: e.g., “Tag a Chicago maker who deserves a bigger spotlight.”

Day 3 (Oct 3) – Official Announcement – Meet CraftLocal! 🎉: This is the big reveal day. We announce the name CraftLocal and what it is. The content can be a short video or simple graphic unveiling our logo and tagline. Caption example: “🎊 Introducing CraftLocal – Chicago’s very own craft marketplace! 🎊 We are launching on Nov 1 to connect Chicago’s amazing makers with people who love handmade, local goods. Whether you’re a crafter or a shopper, get ready for a new way to shop local online. Follow us for updates as we gear up for launch! #CraftLocal #ChicagoMakers #ShopLocal”. This post should clearly communicate: what CraftLocal is, launch date, and why follow. (On Facebook, we might write a slightly longer intro story – the founder’s inspiration or mission statement – to personalize it.) We will also update profile bios on all platforms to reflect what CraftLocal is and that launch is Nov 1. This announcement is crucial for brand awareness – from here on, people know the name behind the teasers.

Day 4 (Oct 4) – Why CraftLocal? (Vendor Benefits): Now that we’ve announced, we start selling the concept to vendors. A post listing key benefits for Chicago craft sellers. Possibly a carousel post on Instagram or a simple infographic on FB/Twitter: “Top 3 Reasons for Chicago Makers to Join CraftLocal:” 1️⃣ Reach Local Customers Online (beyond just weekend fairs); 2️⃣ Just in Time for Holiday Sales (we’ll promote your products for the season); 3️⃣ Be Part of a Local Community (a platform just for Chicago area artisans!). Caption elaborates each point briefly and ends with a call-to-action: “Are you a Chicago creator? 📣 Sign up starts Nov 1 – mark your calendar to be an early CraftLocal vendor! DM us with any questions.” Including a stat can strengthen point 2: e.g., mention how much consumers plan to spend on small businesses this holiday (QuickBooks survey shows $125B expected at small biz
quickbooks.intuit.com
– maybe too large scale, but we can say “Holiday shoppers are projected to spend more at small businesses this year – don’t miss out!”). The tone: encouraging and optimistic, showing that we genuinely want to help local makers succeed.

Day 5 (Oct 5) – Community Highlight / Local Love: A post that grounds CraftLocal in the Chicago community. For example: share a mini-story or shoutout to a known Chicago craft market or artisan (if we have any partners or examples, if not, we can speak generally). “Remember the amazing handmade soap you found at the Logan Square market? Soon, you might find vendors like them on CraftLocal! Our city is full of talent – let’s bring it online.” This could be accompanied by a photo from a Chicago craft fair (with credit if not ours) or a collage of Chicago neighborhood icons + crafts. Purpose: show that we celebrate the existing local craft scene and CraftLocal is an extension of it. Encourage followers to comment with their favorite local artisan or shop (building engagement and maybe leads on vendors to invite).

Day 6 (Oct 6) – How It Works (Sneak Peek): Provide a sneak peek into how CraftLocal will function. Perhaps a few screenshots of the website in development (if available) or a mock interface, shared as images. Caption might say: “Ever wonder how you’ll sell or shop on CraftLocal? Here’s a sneak peek! 📲 Our platform will let you browse by category or neighborhood, message sellers, and discover one-of-a-kind items easily. Sellers, you’ll have a simple dashboard to list products (no tech headaches!). We’re making it easy for you to go from craft table to online store in minutes.” This post aims to alleviate fear of the unknown for vendors (showing a friendly UI) and to excite tech-savvy shoppers who want a convenient way to buy local. Even if we only have wireframes, sharing a glimpse builds trust that this is real and well-designed. If no actual screenshots, we can describe features in a visually engaging text post (maybe an animated graphic cycling through features).

Day 7 (Oct 7) – Local Market Trivia / Poll: Create an interactive post to engage the audience. For example, a Friday fun poll: “Pop Quiz: What Chicago neighborhood do you think has the most artists? 🎨🤔” or “Which craft fairs do you usually attend? [Option A: Renegade Craft, B: Randolph Street Market, C: DIY Trunk Show, D: Other – tell us!]”. On Instagram Stories or Twitter, we can use poll features; on Facebook, encourage commenting. This not only boosts engagement (algorithms love when followers interact), but also subtly does market research for us. In the caption, tie it back to CraftLocal: “We can’t wait to support makers from ALL neighborhoods – citywide creativity!”. The key is to keep it light and community-focused going into the weekend. Also, end the week’s posts by reminding: “Only 3 weeks until launch!” (Starting to introduce the sense of a countdown without daily numbers yet).

Week 2 (Oct 8 – Oct 14): Education and Early Engagement

Theme: This week, we deepen the conversation: educate vendors on how to get ready, and get both vendors and shoppers involved with the brand. We’ll share useful tips (like how to prepare product listings or marketing tips for sellers), continue to promote the “join us” message, and start fostering two-way engagement (user-generated content, answering questions). Also, mid-October is when holiday shopping prep heats up, so we’ll explicitly mention holiday more often now.

Day 8 (Oct 8) – “1 Month to Holiday Season” Motivation: A motivational post for vendors about the upcoming holidays. For example: “The holiday shopping season is around the corner – is your small business ready? 🎁 Chicago makers, we want to help you shine during the holidays. CraftLocal launches Nov 1, giving you nearly 8 weeks of prime holiday selling time online! 🙌”. We can include a short checklist graphic: “October To-Do for Makers: 1️⃣ Stock up inventory, 2️⃣ Take great product photos, 3️⃣ Get ready to list on CraftLocal!”. Caption encourages vendors to start preparing and perhaps asks, “What products are you working on for the holidays? Share a sneak peek! 🔍✨”. This encourages vendors to comment with their product plans (UGC opportunity, plus hype for holiday items). It frames CraftLocal as their partner for holiday success. Also drop a stat like “FYI: Many consumers start holiday shopping in October – don’t wait!” (19% start before October, 41% in November
quickbooks.intuit.com
, indicating early prep matters).

Day 9 (Oct 9) – Meet the Team / Founder Story: Personalize the brand by introducing the people behind CraftLocal. A photo of the founder or team (even if it’s just one or two of us) in a casual, relatable setting (maybe holding a craft item or at a Chicago landmark). Caption: “Hi from the CraftLocal team! 👋 We’re [Name(s)], Chicago locals who believe in the power of our city’s creativity. We started CraftLocal because [brief origin story – e.g., ‘after seeing so many talented friends at craft fairs, we wanted to give them an online home’]. We love Chicago, we love handmade goods, and we’re so excited to launch this platform with you. Feel free to ask us anything in the comments – we’re here, listening! 💬#SmallBiz #StartupStory”. This post builds trust and connection by putting faces to the brand. It signals that we’re approachable and community-driven (not some faceless corporation). Encourage questions in comments – perhaps someone will ask about fees or how shipping works; we should be ready to answer promptly and positively.

Day 10 (Oct 10) – FAQ for Vendors: Anticipate and answer common questions about CraftLocal for those interested in joining. This can be a multi-image carousel or a threaded tweet series. Example questions to address: “What does it cost to sell on CraftLocal?”, “What types of products can I sell?”, “Do I need to be in Chicago?”, “How will shipping or pickup work?”, “When can shoppers start buying?”. We’ll gather these from the PRD or known info. The post could present it like: “CraftLocal Vendor FAQ, Part 1: Q: Do I need my own website to sell? A: Nope! Just register and list your items on our site. It’s free to create an account.”\* etc. We might not have all policies finalized, but share what we can, emphasizing that more info is on the way (or invite them to sign up for an email list for a vendor info packet, if we have one). This informative content positions us as transparent and helpful. It might be lengthy for some platforms, so possibly split into 2–3 Q&As per graphic or per tweet. End with: “Have more questions? Drop them in the comments or DM us! We’ll be happy to answer. 👍”.

Day 11 (Oct 11) – Showcase Potential Product Categories: Get shoppers excited about what they might find on CraftLocal. Do a fun collage image or reel of various craft products (e.g., ceramic mugs, knitted scarves, artwork, jewelry – ideally made by Chicago makers we know, or use stock photos if needed with disclaimer “(examples)”). Caption: “What will you discover on CraftLocal? 🎨🛍️ Possibly a hand-thrown mug from a Logan Square potter, a vintage-inspired print from a Pilsen artist, a cozy scarf hand-knit in Evanston... The possibilities are endless when local creativity comes together! Tell us, what kind of handmade items are you most excited to shop for this holiday?” Then list some emoji categories: 🕯️ Candles? 🍪 Baked treats? 💍 Jewelry? 🎄 Holiday decor?”\*. This engages potential shoppers’ imaginations and also nudges potential vendors of those categories. We can incorporate a couple of hashtags like #HandmadeGifts #ChicagoCrafts. If we have any early confirmed vendors or friends willing to be featured, we could tag them or show one real product as an example (“Sneak peek: @JaneDoeMakes will offer her organic soaps!”). If not, keep it general but enticing.

Day 12 (Oct 12) – Cross-Promotion / Partnership Shoutout: If we have any partnerships or endorsements, highlight one. Perhaps a local business association, craft meetup group, or a well-known local maker who supports us. E.g., “We’re thrilled to have the support of [Local Craft Guild] in our mission to connect Chicago makers and shoppers! 🙌 ” and share a quote from them like “‘CraftLocal is exactly what our community needs,’ says [Name], organizer of XYZ Craft Fair.” Or if no formal partners, we can still do a post like “CraftLocal <3’s Chicago small biz. Shout-out to all the local craft fairs and shops that paved the way (✌️ much respect to @RenegadeCraft, @ChiMakersMarket, etc.). We’re building on that strong foundation to help even more makers thrive online!”. This shows we’re collaborative, not trying to replace or compete nastily with existing channels. Tagging those entities could also get a reshare or at least put us on their radar. The tone is grateful and community-minded.

Day 13 (Oct 13) – Engagement Post – Your Craft Story: Turn the spotlight to our followers, especially the makers. Prompt: “Share your craft story!” Caption idea: “It’s Friday the 13th – a lucky day for sharing your passion! 🎉 Makers: what inspired you to start creating? Shoppers: what do you love about buying handmade? Tell us your story in the comments. We might feature a few in future posts! #FridayIntroductions #CraftCommunity”. This encourages user-generated content and conversation. We can start by leaving a comment from our own account like “Hi, I’m [Name], I started CraftLocal because… [short origin]” to set the example. As responses come in, we will respond to each, making people feel heard. If someone shares a cool story, maybe with their permission we can highlight them in a later post (or at least on Stories). This deepens engagement and builds a sense of community before the platform even launches – people start bonding over the love of crafts on our page itself.

Day 14 (Oct 14) – Weekend Relaxed Post – Inspiration/Meme: Saturdays can have lighter content. Perhaps share an inspirational quote or a crafty humor meme relevant to our audience. For example, a nicely designed quote graphic: “Every time you buy from a small business, an actual person does a happy dance.” – we post this feel-good quote to reinforce the shop-small ethos (with our branding subtly included). Caption: “Never underestimate the power of supporting local. 💛 When you shop from a maker, you make a dream come true. That’s what CraftLocal is all about. #shopsmall #makersmovement”. Alternatively, a gentle joke like a crafting meme (e.g., “I have 99 problems but a stitch ain’t one” for knitters – if appropriate). The goal is to keep the social feed active and interesting, even if not a heavy call-to-action. It makes the brand fun and personable. In comments, we can ask “What are you crafting this weekend?” to keep engagement going.

(At the end of Week 2, we have consistently posted (mostly daily). We’ve revealed the brand, provided information, and started engaging our budding community. Now, people should clearly know what CraftLocal is and be looking forward to it. Next, we’ll ramp up the countdown and promotional push as launch nears.)

Week 3 (Oct 15 – Oct 21): Countdown Begins & Interactive Promotions

Theme: With about two weeks to go, we’ll explicitly start the countdown to launch and use more promotional tactics to generate buzz. This week will include a possible giveaway or contest, more explicit reminders of the launch date, and content that encourages followers to spread the word (referrals, tagging, etc.). We also keep providing value (e.g., last-minute tips for vendors and teasers of products for shoppers).

Day 15 (Oct 15) – “T-minus 2 Weeks!” Countdown Kickoff: It’s exactly 2 weeks before Nov 1, a perfect time to kick off a formal countdown series. Post a graphic with “14 days until CraftLocal launches!” big and bold. Perhaps incorporate a countdown clock visual or numbers. Caption: “The countdown starts NOW – only 14 days until CraftLocal is live! 🗓️🎉 We can’t wait to open the (virtual) doors for Chicago’s makers. Mark your calendars: Nov 1 is launch day. Each day until then, we’ll be sharing sneak peeks, tips, and maybe even some freebies 😉 to get you ready. Stay tuned and spread the word! #CraftLocalCountdown”. The idea is to signal that from here on, every day is special. We might pin this post on Twitter and Facebook so new visitors see we are in countdown mode. Also invite followers: “Know a friend who’d love CraftLocal? Tag them!”.

Day 16 (Oct 16) – Holiday Preview – Gift Guide Teaser: Present a teaser of a holiday gift guide featuring local crafts (to show shoppers what to look forward to once CraftLocal is live). For example, a carousel like “Holiday Gifts Preview: 5 Unique Chicago-Made Gifts you’ll find on CraftLocal” – this could be hypothetical or real examples: (1) Handmade soy candles with Chicago neighborhood scents, (2) Art print of Chicago skyline by local artist, (3) Gourmet fudge from a local confectioner, (4) Hand-knit winter hat, (5) Leather wallet handcrafted in Chicago. Use attractive images for each (if we have actual products from early onboarded vendors, great; if not, use representative images and note “example” or plan to onboard such vendors). Caption: “Looking for the perfect gift that screams Chicago-made? 🎁 We’ve got you. Here’s a sneak peek at some types of gifts you might find on CraftLocal this holiday season. From Wicker Park candles to South Side ceramics, there’ll be something for everyone on your list – all made with love locally. 😍 Which one would you love to give (or get)? #UniqueGifts #HolidayShopping”. This hypes up the shopper side and reinforces to vendors that shoppers will be looking for their goods. It indirectly nudges any not-yet-signed vendor: “hey, if you make something like this, you should be on here.” Also, mention “Full gift guide coming in November!” to imply more marketing support post-launch.

Day 17 (Oct 17) – Giveaway/Contest Announcement: Introduce a simple social media contest to boost engagement and followers. For example: “🎁 CraftLocal Launch Giveaway! 🎁 We’re giving one lucky follower a $50 credit to spend on CraftLocal (or a gift basket of local goodies) when we launch!”. To enter, require actions that increase our reach: “How to enter: 1) Make sure you’re following @CraftLocal on FB/IG/Twitter, 2) Tag 2 friends in the comments who love handmade stuff, 3) [Optional: share this post or retweet for bonus entries].” We will run this contest for a week, then randomly pick a winner on launch day. The prize could be a CraftLocal site credit or if we have swag (like a CraftLocal tote with some local products). Emphasize: “Winner will be announced Nov 1. Open to Chicago-area residents. This is our way of saying thanks for the support and to celebrate our launch!”. Contests are a great way to create hype and encourage user sharing
canva.com
. This particular tactic will get people tagging others (so new folks discover us) and ensure they follow our account. We must ensure the rules are clear and we comply with platform contest guidelines (e.g., “This contest is not affiliated with Instagram”). The tone: fun and celebratory, “We want to share the love!”. This post should be visually eye-catching – maybe a graphic of a gift box with “Giveaway” text. We’ll likely want to promote this across all three platforms (though the mechanism might differ slightly on each, e.g., on Twitter ask for retweet and follow).

Day 18 (Oct 18) – CraftLocal Features Highlight: Highlight a specific cool feature of the platform to keep interest. For example, if CraftLocal will offer local pickup coordination or a map of vendors: “Feature Spotlight: Interactive Map 🗺️ – Explore makers by neighborhood! CraftLocal’s search lets you find artisans in your own community – Lakeview, Bronzeville, you name it. You can even arrange local pickups where possible, saving on shipping and meeting your maker!”. Or if another feature: “Built-in Messenger 💬 – easily chat with sellers for custom requests.”. Choose one feature that sets us apart or appeals to our audience and do a short explainer with an image/icon. Caption: “We built CraftLocal with local needs in mind. Every feature (like [feature]) is aimed at making the experience better for you. What other features do you hope to see? Tell us! #TechForLocal”. This keeps the content from being all marketing; it shows substance behind our promises, which can reassure anyone on the fence about the platform’s quality.

Day 19 (Oct 19) – Testimonial or Early Adopter Quote: If we have any early adopters (maybe a Chicago vendor we’ve pre-signed or someone who has tested the beta), feature their quote: “‘I can’t wait to use CraftLocal to reach more Chicago customers!’ – [Name], owner of [Small Biz Name].” If we don’t have a real one, we might use a hypothetical persona or a supportive quote from a friend who is a maker, with permission. This post serves as a testimonial to validate the concept. The caption can tell a mini story of that person: “[Name] sells handmade jewelry in Logan Square. She usually relies on weekend markets, but is excited about how CraftLocal will let her sell any day, any time. 🙌 We’re building CraftLocal for creators like her (and you!).” Including a nice photo of that person with their craft adds authenticity. It puts a human face to the vendor side of the platform and can inspire other vendors (“if she’s joining, maybe I should too”). If no real photo, use a stock image of a happy craftsperson at work (not ideal, but better than nothing, and disclaim it’s a “maker in Chicago” story). End with: “Are you a maker interested in joining? Reach out, we’d love to chat!”.

Day 20 (Oct 20) – Launch Event Invite (Live or Virtual): If we plan any launch day event or live stream, announce it now. For example, maybe a Facebook/Instagram Live on Nov 1 where we count down and demonstrate the site. Or an in-person pop-up event (if any planned). Post: “You’re Invited: CraftLocal Launch Day Live Chat – Nov 1 @ 12pm! 🎉” and details: “Join us on Instagram Live as we officially launch, give a tour of the site, and answer your questions in real time. We’ll also announce the giveaway winner live! Don’t miss it – set a reminder to hop on and celebrate with us.”. If in-person, give time/location details. Visual: a simple save-the-date image or live icon. Even if it’s just a live Q&A online, this adds an event-like feel to launch day and another reason for people to follow and tune in. Also, it signals transparency (we’ll be there, face to face, to interact). We’ll cross-post this invite on all channels (and create an FB event if doing live stream).

Day 21 (Oct 21) – “One Week to Go!” Hype Video: Exactly one week left. Time for a hype video (could be 30-60 seconds). The video can be a montage: Chicago scenery, snapshots of crafts, text like “7 days until CraftLocal”, snippets of our earlier images, etc., set to upbeat music. If producing a video is possible, great; if not, a fast-paced animated slideshow works. Caption: “7 days and counting… ⏳🎶 We’re on the final stretch to CraftLocal launch! Here’s what’s coming in one week: [bullet list] – A marketplace with 100% local sellers, – Unique gifts at your fingertips, – A community of creators and supporters. This time next week, you could be browsing CraftLocal.com and discovering something amazing from a Chicago neighbor. Who’s excited?! 🙋‍♀️🙋”. Encourage followers to share the video (video content tends to get good engagement). We might also incorporate a few quick testimonial clips or team hello in the video if possible. The goal is to amplify excitement – make people feel like this is the event to look forward to next week. A countdown like this is known to build excitement and provides a reason to keep posting daily reminders without it feeling repetitive

Week 4 (Oct 22 – Oct 28): Final Countdown & Sneak Peeks

Theme: The last full week before launch – by now, we are in full countdown mode. Every day we’ll post a countdown number (5 days, 4 days, etc.) with some fresh angle or content. The messaging will become even more direct: “sign up in X days,” “coming in X days.” We’ll also use this week to address any last concerns (like one more FAQ round), do more sneak peeks of actual site or products, and heavily remind about the benefits and launch details. Essentially, no one following us should miss that this launches Nov 1! We will also likely see our following growing from the contest and tags, so it’s crucial to keep up the momentum and convert that into actual launch day action.

Day 22 (Oct 22) – 5 Days to Go – Vendor How-To Guide: A post highlighting how easy it will be for vendors to start on Day 1. Possibly an infographic: “Getting Started on CraftLocal: 1) Nov 1 – Visit craftlocal.net and click ‘Sign Up’, 2) Create your shop profile (takes 5 minutes), 3) Start listing products (have photos & prices ready), 4) Publish and share your shop link!”. Caption: “⏱️ 5 days until launch! Makers – here’s exactly how you can hit the ground running on Nov 1. We’ve made the onboarding super simple. Tip: Use these last 5 days to take product photos and write descriptions, so you can list them ASAP. Need help? We’ll be around to assist – just reach out. Let’s get you ready to sell! 💪 #VendorTips”. This serves as a final preparatory nudge to vendors. On Twitter, we could break these steps into a short thread. By giving them a mini action plan, we ensure more of them will actually use Day 1 effectively. Also, it conveys that we’ve thought through their experience (building trust).

Day 23 (Oct 23) – 4 Days to Go – Buyer Experience Teaser: Highlight what shoppers can expect on Nov 1. E.g., a short screen-recording video of browsing a category or searching on CraftLocal (if possible), or a series of screenshots: homepage, product page, cart, etc. Caption: “Only 4 days until Chicagoans can shop local artisans from home! 🛒 Here’s a sneak peek at what the CraftLocal shopping experience looks like: [describe: browse by category/neighborhood, see beautiful photos, secure checkout, etc.]. No more waiting for the weekend market – you’ll be able to find that perfect handmade gift anytime. 🎁 Set a reminder to check out CraftLocal.net on Nov 1 and be one of our first shoppers! #SneakPeek #UserExperience”. If feasible, mention any special thing at launch for shoppers (e.g., “Psst: the first 50 orders get a discount/freebie!” if we plan that). Even if not, the post should make shoppers excited to try the site for themselves. It's important not to neglect the buyer side in our final communications – we want eager shoppers browsing as soon as products are up.

Day 24 (Oct 24) – 3 Days – Last Call for Contest & Sign-Up Reminder: A reminder that our giveaway contest (from Day 17) is closing soon. Visual: perhaps repost the giveaway graphic or a countdown variant: “3 days left to launch (and to enter our giveaway)!”. Caption: “Time’s ticking! ⏳ Only 3 days until launch, and only 3 days left to enter our launch giveaway for a $50 CraftLocal shopping credit. Don’t miss your chance – tag two friends on the original contest post and make sure you’re following us. We announce the winner on Nov 1! Also, makers – this is our final call to sign up on our email list for launch updates. Hit our link in bio (or craftlocal.net) to get a launch day reminder so you can be first to create your shop. We can’t wait to welcome you all. #3DaysToGo”. This post creates urgency both for the contest (driving any stragglers to enter, which means more shares) and for vendor sign-ups (if we have an email pre-registration or just to remind them to be ready). If we have a pre-launch email capture on our site, definitely promote it here (“sign up to be notified the minute we launch!”). The tone is energetic and a bit urgent, but still positive.

Day 25 (Oct 25) – 2 Days – Thank You to Community: As we approach the end, take a moment to express gratitude (while still in countdown context). For instance, a heartfelt note from the founders: “🥳 2 days until launch! Today we just want to say THANK YOU. To every person who has followed, liked, commented, given feedback, and cheered us on – you’re the reason we do this. Starting a new platform isn’t easy, but having a supportive community makes it a joy. We’re so excited to start this journey with you in just 48 hours. 💛 Keep spreading the word and let’s make Chicago’s craft community stronger together. – [Your Names], CraftLocal Team.”. Include a team photo or a simple graphic that says “Thank you” with maybe a collage of some supportive comments we’ve gotten (if any). Although it’s a softer sell, it reinforces the community spirit and can deepen loyalty. People appreciate being appreciated. And it subtly says “please keep supporting us/share” without explicitly asking again.

Day 26 (Oct 26) – 1 Day – Launch Eve Hype: It’s the day before launch (Oct 31). Conveniently, that’s Halloween 🎃, so we can have fun with that theme while hyping launch tomorrow. Post idea: a graphic of a pumpkin or candy with text “No tricks, just a treat: CraftLocal launches tomorrow!” or “🎃 Halloween Surprise: CraftLocal Opens Tomorrow!”. Caption: “Happy Halloween, Chicago! 👻 Today might be full of tricks and treats, but we’ve got the sweetest treat coming for you at midnight – CraftLocal opens in just 1 day! 🍬 Tomorrow, Nov 1, get ready to explore and support your local makers like never before. We’ll be celebrating with our live launch event at [time] – join us if you can! Until then, have a safe and fun Halloween. And don’t eat all the candy, you’ll want some while you browse CraftLocal 😉. #1DayToGo #LaunchEve #Halloween”. This makes use of the holiday to create a memorable message. We might even change our profile picture or story to a Halloween version of our logo for the day to show we’re festive. The key info: launch is tomorrow, time to be excited. Possibly mention again the launch live event if we have one (“see you at noon tomorrow on IG Live for the big reveal!”). The tone is celebratory, playful, and anticipatory.

Day 27 (Nov 1) – Launch Day! 🚀: (Though this technically starts week 5, we will include it here as the culmination.) This is the big day we’ve been counting down to. We will have multiple posts across the day to maximize visibility and engagement:

Launch Announcement Post (Morning): Early on Nov 1, a triumphant post: “🌟 We Are LIVE – CraftLocal is Now Open! 🌟”. Caption: “The wait is over – CraftLocal is officially launched! 🥳 Chicago’s first local-only craft marketplace is up and running at craftlocal.net. Vendors: you can now sign up and start listing your products. Shoppers: come take a look at the amazing local goods now available at your fingertips. We want to thank everyone who helped us get here. This is just the beginning – we’ll be onboarding new makers each day, so keep checking back for fresh finds. Dive in, explore, and let us know what you think! Welcome to the CraftLocal family. 💖 #LaunchDay #CraftLocalLaunch”. We’ll attach a compelling image – perhaps a screenshot of the live homepage with lots of products, or a photo of a group of local makers celebrating. Also, this is where we announce the giveaway winner (if we ran the contest): e.g., “🎁 Congratulations to @username, winner of our launch giveaway! We’ll DM you with details.”. Tag them to show it’s legit. This big announcement post should be pinned to profiles and shared widely. Encourage followers to share the news on their feeds/stories (“Help us spread the word – share this post or tag a friend to tell them CraftLocal is open!”). We should expect and encourage a lot of comments (e.g., well-wishes, questions, etc.) and reply to each to boost engagement and algorithm spread.

Launch Day Live / Story Updates (Midday): If we have a live stream or Q&A session, we’ll do that and use Stories to show highlights. For example, post short video clips on IG Story or FB Story: the team cheering “We did it!”, a screen capture of the first order placed (if we get one), etc. Also tweet real-time updates (“First 10 vendors have signed up! So exciting!” or “Our first sale just happened – a handmade candle is going to a new home!”). This real-time content keeps momentum and shows progress, making others want to join in. We don’t need to detail each of these ephemeral posts here, but they are part of the day’s strategy.

Evening Thank-You / Recap Post: In the evening, post a short recap of Day 1 and keep the excitement going. “What a day! 🙌 CraftLocal’s launch day is winding down, and we are overwhelmed (in a good way) by the support. Dozens of Chicago makers have already signed up, and hundreds of products are now available for sale. 🎉 Huge thanks to everyone who visited, shared, and gave us feedback today. If you haven’t checked it out yet, now’s the time – the holiday season is upon us and local gifts await. This is just Day 1, and we’re excited for what’s to come. Onward! #DayOne #Grateful”. Maybe include a photo of a real item sold or a snapshot of the site with “Sold Out” on something, symbolizing success. The purpose is to wrap up the launch communications on a positive note, and transition the social content towards ongoing promotion of site content and sellers.

(Launch day posts mark the end of this 30-day pre-launch plan. Going forward, the social media focus will shift to promoting seller stories, new product listings, buyer testimonials, and holiday promotions like Black Friday/Small Business Saturday campaigns. But those would be part of a separate post-launch content plan.)

Conclusion & Next Steps

This 30-day social media rollout is aggressive and comprehensive, but it’s designed to maximize awareness and engagement for CraftLocal’s launch. By posting nearly every day with a mix of teasers, informative content, interactive posts, and countdown excitement, we keep our audience hooked and growing. Remember, consistency and quality are key – every post provides either value or excitement (preferably both) and maintains our friendly, community-driven tone. The consistent countdown not only builds hype but also gives us a constant stream of content (reminders) without feeling redundant
canva.com
. And by encouraging sharing (through tag-a-friend posts, UGC prompts, and a contest), we leverage word-of-mouth growth which is crucial since we’re not using paid ads at this stage.

A few things to ensure during execution:

Timely Engagement: Respond to comments and messages quickly throughout this campaign. If someone expresses interest in being a vendor, consider reaching out via DM with more info – turning social media interest into actual sign-ups. Engaging promptly also helps with algorithm visibility and shows we care.

Monitor and Adjust: Keep an eye on which posts get the most traction (likes, shares, clicks). If we notice particular content performing well (say, a maker story or a product preview), consider amplifying those (maybe repost on another channel or extend the idea). Conversely, if something falls flat, we learn and tweak future posts.

Visual Branding: Use our CraftLocal logo and branding elements on a lot of the graphics to reinforce brand recognition. Maybe include a small logo watermark on images or use a consistent filter/palette. By launch, people should visually associate certain colors or styles with CraftLocal in their feed.

Hashtag & SEO: Continue using our primary hashtags and even consider searching those hashtags periodically to engage with anyone talking about us. For instance, if someone on Twitter uses #CraftLocal asking “what’s this about?”, we can reply. Also, use the geo-location tags (Instagram location for Chicago, etc.) to catch local eyes.

Community Building: Even after launch, maintain the community vibe – perhaps create a Facebook Group for CraftLocal vendors or a hashtag like #MadeInChicagoMonday where we feature a maker each week. These things aren’t part of the 30-day pre-launch push, but thinking ahead helps ensure continuity after launch day excitement fades.

In summary, this social media plan leverages the lead-up to November 1 as a story – taking our audience from curiosity, to awareness, to excitement, to action on launch day. By the end of October, we aim to have a sizable following of engaged Chicago-area folks who are either ready to list their products or eager to shop, as well as a buzz in the community about CraftLocal’s debut. This proactive pre-launch effort means we won’t be “launching to crickets,” but rather to an audience that’s been waiting and is ready to participate from day one
