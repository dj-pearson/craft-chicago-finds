## HEADLINE

**Craft Chicago Finds Launches First Public Dataset Tracking Local Craft Economy in Real-Time**

*Chicago Craft Economy Index provides unprecedented transparency into city's $3M+ maker economy with live market intelligence*

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Craft Chicago Finds today announced the launch of the **Chicago Craft Economy Index**—the first public, real-time dataset tracking local craft commerce. Based on data from 500+ Chicago makers, 8,400+ listings, and thousands of transactions, the Index provides unprecedented market intelligence including trending categories, neighborhood insights, and seasonal forecasts.

Unlike traditional marketplaces that hoard seller data, Craft Chicago Finds is making this information publicly available to strengthen Chicago's creative economy through transparency.

**Key Stats:**
- 523 active Chicago makers on platform
- $3M+ in total maker earnings to date
- 1,500+ full and part-time jobs supported
- 38% same-day pickup rate (industry unprecedented)
- $42 average item price across all categories

---

## THE STORY ANGLE

### "Infrastructure, Not Just Another Marketplace"

Most craft platforms (Etsy, Amazon Handmade) operate as traditional marketplaces: list products, take a commission, withhold market data.

Craft Chicago Finds is positioning as **essential infrastructure** for local commerce—providing tools, data, and integration that make makers more successful.

The Chicago Craft Economy Index exemplifies this approach: **transparency over data hoarding.**

### Why Now?

After one year of operations and 200+ maker interviews, Craft Chicago Finds identified a critical need: **makers want market intelligence, not just a place to list.**

Questions makers asked repeatedly:
- "Am I pricing too low compared to my neighborhood?"
- "What should I make for Q4 holiday season?"
- "Which categories are trending up?"
- "Where are my buyers located?"

The Index answers these questions—publicly, for free, updated monthly.

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: Why are you giving away your data publicly?

**A:** We believe transparency makes the entire ecosystem stronger. When makers have market intelligence, they price better, stock smarter, and create products buyers actually want. That benefits everyone—including our platform. Data hoarding is a marketplace strategy. Data sharing is infrastructure strategy.

### Q: How is this different from Etsy's seller analytics?

**A:** Etsy shows you YOUR shop data. We show you CHICAGO'S craft economy. That's market intelligence vs individual analytics. Our Index helps makers understand their competitive positioning, seasonal patterns, and neighborhood dynamics—data Etsy won't share.

### Q: What's the business model if you're sharing data?

**A:** We charge a commission on sales (competitive with industry). But unlike pure marketplaces, we provide tools that increase seller revenue. Our data shows sellers using our infrastructure tools (Available Today, Price Coach) see 20-35% revenue increases. We win when makers win.

### Q: Is this data accurate?

**A:** Yes. Based on 500+ sellers, 8,400+ listings, and thousands of real transactions. We represent an estimated 15-20% of Chicago's online craft commerce. All data is aggregated (minimum 10 sellers per data point) and anonymized. Privacy-first methodology.

### Q: Will you expand to other cities?

**A:** Yes. Chicago first (prove the model), then Portland, Austin, Minneapolis in 2025-2026. Each city gets its own Index. Hyperlocal data is the moat—can't be replicated nationally.

### Q: Can I use this data in my research/article/report?

**A:** Absolutely! Please cite as "Chicago Craft Economy Index, Craft Chicago Finds" and link to craftchicagofinds.com/chicago-craft-index. If you'd like specific data cuts or custom analysis, email press@craftchicagofinds.com.
