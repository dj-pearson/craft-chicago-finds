SEO Strategy for Craft Local Marketplace
1. Technical Foundation (Launch-Ready)

Site Architecture:

Flat structure with all key vendor/product pages no more than 3 clicks from home.

Clear hubs: /vendors/, /categories/, /locations/, /guides/.

Each vendor gets a dedicated page with unique content.

Performance (Core Web Vitals 2025 standards):

LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1.

Use WebP images, lazy loading, deferred scripts.

Mobile-First:

Touch-friendly filters (by location, craft type, price).

Sticky cart + checkout buttons.

Crawlability:

XML sitemap auto-updating with new vendors/products.

Robots.txt tuned for indexable product/vendor pages only.

Canonical tags on paginated and filtered URLs.

2. Schema & Structured Data

Marketplace Level:

Organization schema with NAP + social links.

BreadcrumbList schema for navigation.

Vendor Pages:

LocalBusiness schema (with business name, location, hours, contact).

Product schema for featured items (price, availability, reviews).

Content:

FAQPage schema on guides.

HowTo schema on craft DIY/tutorial posts.

Reviews:

Aggregate ratings in Review schema to boost CTR.

3. Keyword Strategy

Focus on bottom-funnel + local intent terms (fastest to convert) and long-tail educational terms (traffic growth).

Tier 1: High-Intent

“buy handmade [product] online”

“local craft marketplace [city/state]”

“[city] handmade jewelry vendors”

“[product] near me”

Tier 2: Educational

“best gifts from local artists [year]”

“how to support local vendors online”

“handmade vs mass-produced gifts”

Tier 3: AI/Answer Engine Questions

“Where can I find local handmade [product] near me?”

“Which online marketplace supports local vendors?”

Tactic: Create comparison pages (“Etsy vs Craft Local Marketplace”), and curated list posts (“Top 10 Handmade Candles by Local Makers”).

4. Content Strategy

Hub Pages (pillars):

/categories/handmade-jewelry/

/categories/home-decor/

/categories/art/

/categories/gifts/

Local Landing Pages:

/local/[city]/ → highlight vendors in that area.

Blog/Resource Center:

Gift guides, seasonal posts, vendor stories.

Answer-first format (AI-friendly). Example:

Q: “What’s the best handmade gift under $50?”

Direct Answer with product list + CTA.

Video + Short Guides: Tutorials (e.g., “How to care for handmade pottery”). Cross-post on YouTube/Instagram for backlinks.

5. Link Building & Authority

Vendor Cross-Promotion: Encourage vendors to link their websites/socials back to their profile.

Local Media & Blogs: Pitch stories about “supporting local” and marketplace launch.

Partnerships: Collaborate with chambers of commerce, farmer’s markets, local events.

Directories: Get listed in Yelp, Google Business Profile, Bing Places, Apple Maps.

6. Local SEO

Google Business Profile: Create one for the marketplace (and help vendors optimize theirs).

Location Pages: Include local stats, featured artisans, customer testimonials.

Local Content: Blog about city events, fairs, and how your marketplace supports local economies.

7. Conversion Optimization

Landing Pages:

Above-the-fold CTA: “Shop Local Now”.

Social proof: vendor count, total items sold, trust badges.

Trust Signals:

Verified vendor badges.

Secure checkout (SSL + compliance icons).

Real reviews with photos.

Progressive Profiling:

Start with email capture (“Join to support local”).

Add preferences later (favorite categories, budget).

8. AI Search & Emerging SEO

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO):

Add Q&A snippets at top of blog posts.

Use lists, tables, checklists.

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO):

Use expert bylines (local craft leaders, artisans).

Publish original data (e.g., “2025 Local Craft Trends”).

Ensure schema JSON-LD is clean and complete.

9. Analytics & Tracking

Tools: GA4, Google Search Console, Looker Studio dashboard.

Events to Track:

Vendor signups.

Add-to-cart actions.

Checkout completions.

Newsletter signups.

KPIs:

First 6 months: Page 1 for 20+ local craft queries, 5k+ monthly organic visitors.

Year 1: 50k+ monthly organic, 25% vendor acquisition through SEO.

10. Launch Timeline

Weeks 1–2: Technical SEO (sitemap, schema, CWV, crawlability).

Weeks 3–4: Publish vendor hubs + 4 blogs (gift guides, “vs Etsy”).

Weeks 5–8: Local landing pages, review generation, link outreach.
