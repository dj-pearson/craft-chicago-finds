# Meet Sarah Chen: Inside a Chicago Ceramic Artist's Logan Square Studio

*Part of our ongoing series profiling the talented makers who make Chicago's handmade community thrive.*

On a crisp November morning, I visited Sarah Chen's ceramic studio tucked above a vintage shop on Milwaukee Avenue in Logan Square. The sun streamed through tall industrial windows, illuminating rows of mugs, bowls, and planters in various stages of completion. The air smelled of wet clay and coffee—Sarah was throwing her third mug of the day by 10 AM.

"I try to get at least 20 pieces thrown before lunch," Sarah explains, her hands steady on the potter's wheel. "Repetition is how you improve. Every mug teaches me something new."

Sarah Chen has been a fixture in Chicago's ceramic arts community for seven years. Her minimalist, functional pottery—characterized by clean lines, soft neutral glazes, and surprising pops of cobalt blue—has earned her a devoted following. Her work is available at Craft Chicago Finds, local boutiques, and seasonal art fairs throughout the city.

## The Journey to Full-Time Pottery

Sarah didn't start out as a potter. She studied graphic design at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) and worked in advertising for five years. "I was designing things all day on a screen, but I missed making things with my hands," she recalls.

She took her first pottery class at Lillstreet Art Center in 2017—a weekend wheel-throwing workshop. "I was terrible," she laughs. "My first bowl collapsed. My second one had a hole in the bottom. But I was hooked."

For two years, Sarah took evening classes while working her day job. She practiced on weekends, filled her apartment with wonky bowls, and gave away mugs to every friend and family member. In 2019, she rented studio space at The Pottery Studio Chicago in Ravenswood and started selling at local art fairs.

"The first time someone bought one of my mugs at a craft fair, I cried," Sarah admits. "They chose my work over hundreds of other makers. That feeling never gets old."

By 2021, Sarah's pottery sales matched her design salary. She made the leap to full-time making, moving into her current Logan Square studio space—a 600-square-foot room with tall ceilings, natural light, and enough room for two pottery wheels, a worktable, and kiln access in the shared firing room.

## Inside Sarah's Studio

Sarah's studio is organized chaos. Shelves along one wall hold bags of clay, buckets of glaze, and tools accumulated over years—wire cutters, ribs, sponges, and a well-worn collection of trimming tools. Her primary wheel sits in front of the windows, positioned to catch the best light.

"Natural light is essential," Sarah explains. "I can see the subtle curves and edges better. It helps me gauge wall thickness and spot imperfections."

A second wheel in the corner serves as a dedicated space for testing new forms or larger pieces. Nearby, her worktable is covered with mugs in various stages—some leather-hard and ready for trimming, others waiting for handles.

The drying shelves hold this week's production: 30 mugs, 15 bowls, 12 planters, and a few experimental pieces. "I work in batches," Sarah says. "It's more efficient and helps me refine each form through repetition."

Her kiln schedule dictates her workflow. She bisque-fires every other Wednesday and glaze-fires on Fridays, sharing kiln space with three other studio members. "The kiln is a communal resource, which means I have to plan ahead and coordinate with other makers. It teaches patience."

## The Creative Process: From Clay to Finished Piece

Sarah works primarily in mid-fire stoneware—a durable, versatile clay body that she sources from Continental Clay Company. Each piece starts as a measured ball of clay, weighed precisely to ensure consistency.

"For my standard 12-ounce mug, I use 650 grams of clay," she explains, weighing out a portion. "This gives me enough clay for the walls and a small allowance for trimming."

At the wheel, Sarah centers the clay with practiced efficiency—a process that took her months to master. "Centering is everything," she says. "If your clay isn't perfectly centered, everything that comes after will be off."

She opens the clay, establishes the floor of the mug, and pulls the walls up in three steady pulls. Her movements are fluid, economical. Within five minutes, a perfectly cylindrical form emerges. She uses a rib tool to compress and smooth the interior, then a metal kidney to refine the outside curve.

The freshly thrown mug joins others on a ware board, covered loosely with plastic to dry slowly overnight. "Slow, even drying prevents cracking," Sarah notes. "Rushing this stage ruins pieces."

The next day, when the mugs reach leather-hard stage—firm but still workable—Sarah trims the bottoms. She flips each mug onto the wheel, centers it carefully, and carves away excess clay to create a foot ring. This is where her designer's eye shines. The proportions matter: foot diameter, height, the curve of the transition from wall to base.

"This is my favorite part," Sarah admits. "Trimming transforms a cylinder into a finished form. You can see the piece come to life."

After trimming, she pulls and attaches handles—rolling coils of clay, shaping them to fit comfortably in hand, and scoring and slipping them onto each mug body. Handle attachment is an art form. "The handle has to look good, but more importantly, it has to feel good," Sarah explains. "I test the grip, the finger placement, the balance when you lift the mug full of coffee."

## Glazing: Where Science Meets Art

After the bisque firing transforms the fragile greenware into hard, porous ceramic, it's time for glazing. Sarah has developed a signature glaze palette: soft whites, warm off-whites, subtle grays, and her signature cobalt blue.

"I mix most of my glazes from scratch," she says, showing me her glaze recipes—carefully documented in a worn notebook. "It gives me control over the exact color and finish."

She dips each piece in glaze, holding it with tongs and timing the immersion precisely. Three seconds for a thinner coat, five for richer coverage. The raw glaze looks nothing like the finished result—the cobalt blue appears chalky gray, the white is dusty pink.

"This is where trust comes in," Sarah laughs. "You glaze these pieces and have no idea if they'll turn out until they come out of the kiln. It's nerve-wracking every single time."

## The Chicago Maker Community

Sarah credits much of her success to Chicago's supportive maker community. She's part of a ceramics critique group that meets monthly, shares kiln space with fellow potters, and collaborates on pop-up sales and studio tours.

"Chicago makers genuinely support each other," she says. "We share glaze recipes, recommend each other to customers, and celebrate wins together. It doesn't feel competitive—it feels collaborative."

She participates in the annual Logan Square Arts Festival, Pilsen Open Studios, and the Chicago Craft Mafia's holiday market. "Art fairs are exhausting but essential," she admits. "You meet customers face-to-face, get immediate feedback, and build relationships. People want to know the maker behind the mug."

Being listed on Craft Chicago Finds has expanded her reach beyond art fairs. "I love that it's Chicago-focused," Sarah says. "Customers find me through the platform, and I offer same-day pickup from my studio. People come by, see my workspace, and often buy more than they originally intended. There's value in that personal connection."

## Sarah's Products and Pricing

Sarah's current collection includes:

**Coffee Mugs** ($38-$42) - Her signature product, available in five glaze options, 12-14 oz capacity, dishwasher and microwave safe

**Bowls** ($45-$68) - Cereal bowls, ramen bowls, and serving bowls ranging from 16 oz to 48 oz

**Custom Orders** - Sarah accepts commissions for personalized glaze colors, sizes, or quantities (typically 4-6 week lead time)

Her pricing reflects the hours of skilled labor: "A single mug represents about 45 minutes of active work—throwing, trimming, handle attachment, glazing—plus two firings. When you break it down, I'm not getting rich. But I'm making a living doing something I love in a city I love."

## What's Next for Sarah

Looking ahead, Sarah plans to expand her dinnerware offerings and experiment with larger sculptural pieces. She's also considering teaching workshops—passing on the skills she's developed.

"I'd love to help others experience what I felt in that first pottery class," she reflects. "That moment when you realize you can create something beautiful and functional with your own hands. That's powerful."

You can find Sarah's work on Craft Chicago Finds, with same-day pickup available from her Logan Square studio by appointment. She also maintains an Instagram (@sarahchenceramics) where she shares studio updates, process videos, and kiln opening reveals.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does it take Sarah to make one mug?**

From start to finish, each mug takes about 3 weeks—not because of active work time (about 45 minutes per mug), but because of necessary drying and firing stages.
