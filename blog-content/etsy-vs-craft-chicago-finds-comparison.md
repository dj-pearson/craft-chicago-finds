# Etsy vs Craft Chicago Finds: Complete Comparison for Chicago Makers (2025)

If you're a Chicago maker deciding where to sell your handmade goods online, you've likely considered Etsy. It's the biggest name in handmade e-commerce, with 96 million active buyers and 7.5 million sellers worldwide. But is bigger always better?

For Chicago-based makers, there's an increasingly compelling alternative: Craft Chicago Finds, a marketplace built specifically for local artisans. In this comprehensive comparison, we'll break down the fees, features, benefits, and trade-offs of each platform to help you make an informed decision for your handmade business in 2025.

## The Bottom Line: Commission Fees

Let's start with what matters most to makers: how much does each platform cost?

### Etsy Fee Structure (2025)

Etsy's fee structure has multiple layers:

- **Listing Fee**: $0.20 per item (expires after 4 months or when sold)
- **Transaction Fee**: 6.5% of the sale price (including shipping)
- **Payment Processing Fee**: 3% + $0.25 per transaction
- **Offsite Ads Fee**: 15% of sale price (12% for sellers with $10,000+ annual sales) - **automatically charged** if a customer comes from Etsy's external advertising
- **Pattern/Plus Fees**: $10-15/month for custom shop features (optional)
- **Shipping Label Fees**: Variable, though often competitive

**Real Example**: You sell a handmade ceramic mug for $40 with $8 shipping.

- Transaction fee: $3.12 (6.5% of $48)
- Payment processing: $1.69 (3% + $0.25)
- Listing fee: $0.20
- **Total fees**: $5.01 (10.4%)
- **If Offsite Ads triggered**: Additional $7.20 (15% of $48) = **$12.21 total (25.4%)**

Etsy's effective commission rate ranges from **10-25%** depending on whether Offsite Ads are triggered—and makers have no control over when that happens.

### Craft Chicago Finds Fee Structure (2025)

Our fee structure is transparent and straightforward:

- **Listing Fee**: $0 (unlimited free listings)
- **Transaction Fee**: 10% of the sale price only (shipping not included)
- **Payment Processing Fee**: Standard Stripe fees (2.9% + $0.30)
- **No Offsite Ads**: We don't charge for our marketing efforts
- **No Subscription Fees**: All features included
- **No Renewal Fees**: Listings stay active until sold

**Same Example**: You sell a handmade ceramic mug for $40 with $8 shipping.

- Transaction fee: $4.00 (10% of $40)
- Payment processing: $1.46 (2.9% + $0.30 on $40 sale)
- **Total fees**: $5.46 (13.6% of sale price, 11.4% including shipping)

**The Difference**: On this single sale, you keep **$6.75 more** with Craft Chicago Finds (when Offsite Ads are triggered on Etsy). Over 100 sales, that's **$675 back in your pocket**.

**2. International Sales**
If you're willing to ship internationally and deal with customs, Etsy opens doors to global markets. Some makers build successful businesses selling to European or Australian markets.

Etsy has refined their platform over 18 years. The tools work, the shipping label integration is smooth, and the customer service infrastructure is mature.

## Real Maker Testimonials

**Maria Rodriguez, Jewelry Maker** (sells on both platforms):
"I keep my Etsy shop active because it's been around for 8 years and has momentum. But I make better margins on Craft Chicago Finds, and I love the local customers. They come to my studio, see my workspace, and often become repeat buyers. I've built real relationships. On Etsy, I'm just a shop among millions."

**James Park, Woodworker**:
"I left Etsy after they hit me with a $400 Offsite Ads charge in one month. I had no control over it, and it wiped out my entire profit for the month. Craft Chicago Finds' transparent pricing gives me peace of mind. I know exactly what I'll pay on each sale."

**Keisha Williams, Ceramic Artist**:
"Craft Chicago Finds features me in blog posts and promotes Chicago makers on social media for free. On Etsy, I'd have to pay for that visibility. The community feel makes a huge difference."

## Can You Use Both?

**Yes!** Many makers maintain shops on both platforms. Here's a smart strategy:

### Multi-Platform Strategy

**Use Etsy for:**
- Building initial audience and sales history
- Reaching buyers outside Chicago
- Products that ship easily and inexpensively
- Testing new products with large audience
- International sales

**Use Craft Chicago Finds for:**
- Higher-margin local sales
- Same-day pickup orders
- Building Chicago customer relationships
- Larger items where shipping is expensive
- Custom local orders
- Community connection and networking

**Pro Tip**: Don't use identical listings. Vary your product photos, titles, and descriptions to avoid confusing buyers and to optimize each platform differently.

## The Decision Framework

### Choose Etsy if:

- You're brand new and need immediate sales to build confidence
- Your niche is very specific and  not location-dependent
- You make lightweight, easily shippable items
- You have time to invest in Etsy SEO and marketing
- You're comfortable with higher fees for larger audience access
- You want international exposure

### Choose Craft Chicago Finds if:

- You're Chicago-based and can offer pickup/local delivery
- You want to maximize profit margins (keep 30-50% more per sale)
- You value community over pure sales volume
- You're frustrated with Etsy's fees, competition, or algorithm changes
- You want to support and participate in local economy
- You prefer transparent, predictable fees
- You can benefit from same-day pickup as a selling point
- You want to build direct customer relationships

### Choose Both if:

- You want to maximize reach while prioritizing local
- You can manage inventory across two platforms
- You want the security of diversified sales channels
- You're willing to invest time in both platforms

## Looking Ahead: The Future of Handmade Marketplaces

The handmade marketplace landscape is shifting. Sellers are increasingly frustrated with Etsy's rising fees, algorithm changes, and dilution of "handmade" standards. Etsy's 2024 seller survey showed 62% of sellers are "somewhat" or "very" dissatisfied with recent platform changes.

Meanwhile, hyper-local marketplaces are growing. Buyers increasingly value:
- Knowing where products come from
- Meeting makers
- Supporting local economies
- Sustainable, low-shipping-footprint purchases
- Authentic handmade goods (not mass-produced imports labeled "handmade")

Craft Chicago Finds represents this shift—a return to genuine local commerce, maker-buyer relationships, and community-focused platforms that put makers first.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Will Craft Chicago Finds replace Etsy for me?

It depends on your business model. If you rely heavily on international sales or sell highly niche products, Etsy might remain your primary platform. But for most Chicago makers, Craft Chicago Finds can handle 50-100% of your local sales at significantly better margins. Many makers use both strategically.

### Q: What if I'm not getting enough sales on Craft Chicago Finds?

The platform is growing, and we're actively investing in marketing to Chicago buyers (local SEO, social media, partnerships, press coverage). We also offer free marketing support—maker features, blog posts, social shares—to help drive traffic to your shop. Plus, with same-day pickup and lower prices (thanks to lower fees), you have compelling advantages to promote.

### Q: Can I offer the same products on both platforms?

Yes, though we recommend differentiating your listings slightly (different photos, titles, or descriptions) to avoid duplicate content issues and to optimize for each platform's audience. Make sure you manage inventory carefully to avoid overselling.

### Q: What about Etsy's built-in audience—isn't that worth the higher fees?

It can be, but consider: Etsy's organic reach has declined significantly for new and small sellers. You're competing with millions of shops, and standing out requires paid ads or Offsite Ads (15% fee). On Craft Chicago Finds, your visibility is much higher per impression because buyers are browsing a curated selection of 200 makers, not millions.

### Q: How do I transition from Etsy to Craft Chicago Finds?

Start by listing a selection of your best-selling items on Craft Chicago Finds. Promote your Craft Chicago Finds shop to your local customers, at art fairs, and on social media. Track which platform gives you better margins and customer relationships. You can keep both active or gradually shift depending on results.

### Q: What if Etsy is already working well for me?

That's great! Keep your Etsy shop. Consider adding Craft Chicago Finds as a second channel for local sales to diversify your revenue and build local customer relationships. Having both reduces your dependency on any single platform—which is smart business.

### Q: Does Craft Chicago Finds offer seller protection like Etsy?

Yes. We have seller protections, verified buyer reviews only, secure payment processing through Stripe, and dedicated seller support. If issues arise, you work with a real person who understands the Chicago maker community, not an automated system.

### Q: Can I wholesale through Craft Chicago Finds?

We're developing wholesale and bulk order tools specifically for Chicago retailers who want to stock local makers' goods. This feature is coming in 2025. In the meantime, retailers can contact you directly through the platform for wholesale inquiries.

## Conclusion: The Right Choice for Your Business

There's no universal right answer. Etsy and Craft Chicago Finds serve different purposes and can coexist in your sales strategy.

**Etsy** remains a powerful platform for reaching a massive global audience—if you're willing to pay the fees and invest in standing out among millions of competitors.

**Craft Chicago Finds** offers a compelling alternative for Chicago makers who value community, local connection, transparent fees, and higher profit margins. For local sales, we provide better economics and deeper customer relationships.

Our recommendation: **Start with Craft Chicago Finds if you're Chicago-based**. The signup is free, listings are free, and there's no risk. Test it for 90 days while maintaining your Etsy shop. Track your margins, customer relationships, and overall satisfaction with each platform. Let the data guide your decision.

The makers who win in 2025 will be those who strategically choose platforms aligned with their values, products, and business goals—not just defaulting to the biggest name.
